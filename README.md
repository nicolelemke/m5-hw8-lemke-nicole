For this assignment I found your example/read me files from lecture Module 5 to be much more helpful then the notes from Module 4 lecture for the pizza assignment.

Oddly enough I remember more about event listeners from last semester in Advanced Web 1 than I do the basics from the pizza assignment.

Where I get confused is:
1. There are mutiple ways to write things. 
2. I usually understand what you're asking but am still struggling with how to start each instruction. Do I start with a var or function or if statement or what?

The instructions //noted in this were EXTREMELY helpeful though.

Things I could use more practice on are arrays commbined with math. It's still kind of confusing to me how it works. If you have any more pratice assignments like this I think that be very helpful. Or any pratice online activties for understanding the differences between them all, that be great! I remember when learning flex box there was a online frog tutorial game that helped alot, not sure if there is anything out there to help guide you JS for what to use and when.

My brother only helped a minimal amount on this to understand the loop part.

Thanks!
